# Rotation
This repo is created to rotate different things. Projecting 3d rotation to 2d. Possibly work on 4d to 3d
Practice creating JFrame without Intellij's aids (code only)
This project is inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzsgS19RRc8
I basically created a matrix multiplication package, and use that multiplicatoin package to do various things such as rotating and projecting. I two different kinds of matrices in this project, rotation matrix and projection matrix. The one that is harder to understand would be the projection matrix, the projection matrix would have domain of dimensoin 3 and codomain of dimension 2, or it sends something from 3 d to possibly 2d. We can think of this as the center of our sight would be the center of the euclidean plane that we are projecting our motion on. What we see and perceive as 3d can be captured in pictures, and we are just doing the same here. I used the standard projection matrix, with everything in standard basis. That means I send things that are made of (1,0,0)(0,1,0)(0,0,1) to things that are made of (1,0)(0,1)
